# INFO201 LAB 1

Hi, my name is **Minerva Kim**
and I am really excited to take *INFO201*.
My friends have told me informatics is a fun subject and that the professors are great teachers!
Some specific things I am ecstatic to learn in this class are:
1. I am excited to learn what are the fundamental skills are for **data science** because the course uses the book "Programming skills for data science". 
2. During summer 2019, I took a course on big data where my professor taught the class how to use R. It was my first introduction to big data which I really enjoyed so I am excited to further develop my knowledge and expertise on **R**.
3. Finally I am excited to learn about **front-end web development**! Web development is coding but it also needs design expertise which I think will be fun. 

Thank you for reading this and I look forward to working with everyone and the subjects we will dive into!
